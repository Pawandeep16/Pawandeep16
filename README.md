Hi, I’m a passionate web developer, graphic designer, and full stack enthusiast. I love creating beautiful and functional websites and apps using React and React Native. I’m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. 💻

🔭 I’m currently working on some personal projects that involve web development, graphic design, and full stack development. I enjoy exploring different aspects of web development, such as front-end, back-end, UI/UX, and SEO. 🚀

🌱 I’m currently learning more about Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, and AWS. I’m also interested in learning more about Flutter, Django, and Laravel. 📚

👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other developers and designers on exciting and challenging projects. I’m open to new opportunities and feedback. 🙌

📫 You can reach me at my thandipawandeep@gmail.com or connect with me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawandeep-thandi-2432031ab/ . I’d love to hear from you. 😊

💬 Ask me anything about web development, graphic design, or full stack development. I’m happy to share my knowledge and experience with you. 🙋‍♂️

😄 Fun fact: I like to play video games, watch movies, designing 🎨 and listen to music in my free time. 🎮🎬🎧
